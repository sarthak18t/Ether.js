# Ether.js

Provider	A Provider (in ethers) is a class which provides an abstraction for a connection to the Ethereum Network. 
It provides read-only access to the Blockchain and its status.

Signer	A Signer is a class which (usually) in some way directly or indirectly has access to a private key, 
which can sign messages and transactions to authorize the network to charge your account ether to perform operations.	

Contract	A Contract is an abstraction which represents a connection to a specific contract on the Ethereum Network,
so that applications can use it like a normal JavaScript object.
